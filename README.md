### ChessEvaluator
 
This is an app which allows users to evaluate Chess Positions shown to them one at a time on screen. It uses Jetpack Compose for the UI, and Firebase for back-end data storage and user authentication.

The app consists of six main screens:

1. Log-in
2. Dashboard
3. Position Evaluation
4. Profile/Stats
5. Leaderboard
6. Settings

TODO: Get basic action for all UI screens and render the app.
TODO: Implement all buttons used in the Figma wireframe, without any functionality.
